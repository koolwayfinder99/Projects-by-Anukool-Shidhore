# Bio-Inspired Quadruped Robot Design & Kinematic Analysis

**Role:** Robotics Mechanical Engineer
**Duration:** Aug 2025 - Sep 2025
**Tech Stack:** SolidWorks, MATLAB, ANSYS, Kinematics (DH-Matrices)

## Project Overview
Engineered the mechanical and kinematic framework for a quadruped robot inspired by Boston Dynamics' SPOT. The project focused on stability analysis and locomotion intelligence through mathematical modeling.

## Key Technical Contributions
* **Kinematic Analysis:** Modeled complex linkage mechanisms and performed rigorous kinematic analysis using **DH-Matrices** and **Jacobian methods** to define the robot's workspace and joint trajectories.
* **Mechanical Design:** Designed the chassis and legs in **SolidWorks**, focusing on linkage mechanisms for optimal range of motion.
* **FEA Validation:** Validated the design through static structural analysis in **ANSYS** to ensure the chassis and actuator arms could withstand dynamic loads during gait cycles.
* **Outcome:** Bridged the gap between theoretical robot mathematics and industrial application.
