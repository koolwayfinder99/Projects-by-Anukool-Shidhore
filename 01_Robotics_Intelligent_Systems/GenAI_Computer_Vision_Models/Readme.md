# Generative AI & Computer Vision Models for Robotics

**Role:** AI Researcher / Student
**Duration:** Sep 2024 - Nov 2024
**Tech Stack:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, CNNs, GANs, MNIST, Python

## Project Overview
Designed and trained advanced Machine Learning models to enhance robotic perception and interaction capabilities. Explored both discriminative (classification) and generative (creative) AI architectures.

## Key Technical Contributions
* **Deep Learning Architectures:** Developed **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for high-accuracy image classification, optimizing weights and biases for minimal loss.
* **Generative Models:** Deployed **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** on the MNIST dataset to understand underlying data distributions and generate synthetic training data.
* **NLP Integration:** Explored Natural Language Processing (NLP) by integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** via Hugging Face libraries to create conversational agents for human-robot interaction.
