# Autonomous Mobile Robot Simulation (ROS 2 & SLAM)

**Role:** Robotics Engineer
**Duration:** Sep 2024 - Sep 2025
**Tech Stack:** ROS 2 (Humble), Nav2, SLAM Toolbox, Gazebo, LiDAR

## Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive autonomous navigation stack for a mobile robot within a simulated environment, focusing on localization and path planning in dynamic spaces.

## Technical Implementation
* **SLAM & Navigation:** Integrated **SLAM Toolbox** for mapping and **Nav2** for autonomous path planning, enabling the robot to navigate complex mazes without human intervention.
* **Sensor Fusion:** Fused data from **LiDAR** and camera sensors to create accurate costmaps for obstacle avoidance.
* **Simulation:** Built a custom URDF model and simulation environment in **Gazebo Classic**, implementing OpenCV nodes for visual feature extraction.
* **Outcome:** Successfully demonstrated autonomous loop closure and dynamic replanning in an unstructured environment.
