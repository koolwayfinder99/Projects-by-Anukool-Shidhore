# 3D Printed Boat Race (MEW) - Autonomous Marine Robotics

**Role:** Mechatronics Architect & Product Designer
**Duration:** Nov 2025
**Tech Stack:** Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Additive Manufacturing, RC Electronics, PID Control

## Project Overview
Engineered a high-performance hydrodynamic hull for an autonomous boat race. The project focused on optimizing geometry for minimal drag and stability while adhering to additive manufacturing constraints.

## Key Technical Contributions
* **CAD & Simulation:** Designed the hull using **SolidWorks** and **Fusion 360**, performing iterative simulations to optimize buoyancy and hydrodynamic stability.
* **Manufacturing:** Managed the complete 3D printing workflow, selecting optimal print parameters and materials (PLA/PETG) to create a lightweight, watertight, and durable chassis.
* **Mechatronics Integration:** Integrated the electro-mechanical drive system, including brushless motors, Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs), and steering servos.
* **Tuning:** Tuned the control stability and steering response to complete all race phases competitively.
