# Collegiate Motorsports & Vehicle Dynamics (BAJA SAE / SUPRA)

**Role:** Head of Vehicle Dynamics & Suspension Lead
**Duration:** Jan 2020 - Jan 2023
**Tech Stack:** ANSYS, MATLAB/Simulink, Lotus Shark, SolidWorks, FEA

## Project Overview
Led the vehicle dynamics team for national off-road racing competitions (SAE BAJA). Focused on suspension geometry, braking systems, and structural optimization to withstand extreme loads.

## Key Technical Contributions
* **Dynamics & Simulation:** Developed custom suspension geometry capable of withstanding **4G dynamic loads**. Used **Lotus Shark** and **MATLAB** to optimize roll centers and camber gain.
* **Structural Analysis:** Conducted rigorous Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using **ANSYS** to validate the roll cage and suspension arms, reducing weight while ensuring driver safety.
* **Mechanical Design:** Engineered a custom compact differential gearbox and power transmission system to improve off-road maneuverability.
* **Achievements:** Secured **2nd Place National Rank** in Suspension & Traction category through rigorous validation and endurance testing.
