# Rover to Mars (University Rover Challenge)

**Role:** Power Systems Lead & Robotics Engineer
**Duration:** Sep 2024 - Aug 2025
**Tech Stack:** ROS 2 (Humble), Python, Gazebo, Power Electronics, SolidWorks

## Project Overview
Lead Power Systems Engineer for the University Rover Challenge (URC) team. Responsible for bridging the gap between hardware power distribution and autonomous software logic.

## Key Technical Contributions
* **Robotics & Simulation:** Engineered the rover's navigation stack using **ROS 2** and **Nav2**, validating kinematic models in **Gazebo** to ensure stability before physical testing.
* **Perception:** Implemented computer vision algorithms using **OpenCV** and Python to detect terrain obstacles and autonomous markers.
* **Power Electronics:** Designed the central power distribution system (PDS) to regulate high-current delivery to drive motors while maintaining stable voltage for sensitive compute units (Jetson/NUC).
* **Hardware:** Integrated Battery Management Systems (BMS) for safety and utilized 3D printing to manufacture lightweight chassis components.
