# Design & Analysis of Open Differential Gearbox

**Role:** Mechanical Designer
**Duration:** May 2022 - Aug 2022
**Tech Stack:** CATIA V5, ANSYS Workbench, GD&T

## Project Overview
Engineered a compact straight bevel open differential gearbox, optimizing gear geometry for efficient power transmission and durability.

## Key Technical Contributions
* **3D Modeling:** Utilized **CATIA V5 R21** for detailed 3D modeling of the gear assembly and casing.
* **Structural Validation:** Performed rigorous structural validation using **ANSYS Workbench 19.2**, simulating static and tangential load cases to minimize stress concentrations.
* **Manufacturing Ready:** Applied Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (**GD&T**) to ensure manufacturability and mechanical integrity.
