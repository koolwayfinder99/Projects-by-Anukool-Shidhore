# Design of IT-SOFC Emission Control System for ATV

**Role:** Sustainable Design Engineer
**Duration:** Mar 2021 - Sep 2021
**Tech Stack:** Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC), Automotive Engineering, Thermodynamics

## Project Overview
Designed a sustainable emission control solution for the BAJA SAEINDIA 2021 "Go Green" event, integrating an Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC) into an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV).

## Key Technical Contributions
* **System Design:** Replaced traditional catalytic converters with a system that actively repurposes engine exhaust gases to lower the vehicle's carbon footprint.
* **Energy Recovery:** Engineered the system to utilize heat and chemical energy from exhaust to convert harmful pollutants (NOx/CO) into harmless byproducts while generating auxiliary electricity.
