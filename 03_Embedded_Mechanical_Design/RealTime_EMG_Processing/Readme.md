# Real-Time EMG Bio-Signal Processing (STM32F4)

**Role:** Embedded Control Engineer
**Duration:** Oct 2025 - Present
**Tech Stack:** STM32F4 Discovery, MATLAB/Simulink, Olimex SHIELD, Signal Processing

## Project Overview
Developed a real-time electromyography (EMG) control system to acquire and process signals from forearm muscles, translating biological signals into robotic actuation.

## Key Technical Contributions
* **Signal Pipeline:** Implemented a rigorous signal processing pipeline in **MATLAB/Simulink** involving band-pass filtering, rectification, and normalization based on Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC).
* **Embedded Control:** Engineered the control logic on the **STM32F4** to actuate a servomotor and modulate LED intensity proportional to muscle contraction thresholds.
* **Verification:** Verified the robustness of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) through host-target data transmission tests.
